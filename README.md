# Project description
In this project, I explored the bikeshare dataset to create an interactive experience to present summary statistics about the data.

# Software used
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)

# Files
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

# Outside resources used:
This website was used to find an alternative to weekday_name as I received an error in Jupyter notebook when using that function.
From this resource I found the dt.day_name() function to use instead. This function is used to get the day of the week name from a date column.
